# Episode 2 - Zero Build Zone

[00:00:00] 

**RapidRaven880:** Welcome to episode two of Zero Build Zone. I am RapidRaven880. And with me I have my co-host, MatosPT. Welcome.

**MatosPT:** Hello, hello! 

**RapidRaven880:** So welcome to the second episode. We have an episode full of things to talk about and we're going to jump straight into the one punch Medallion in Blitz recently added, which took me by surprise. ~~Have you seen it before?~~

**MatosPT:** ~~Uh, no, I think it's first. Uh, ~~quite interesting the way they approach the anime lore the lore of Fortnite. So basically the Medallion allows you to one punch an enemy. [00:01:00] And Fortnite doesn't allow punching, just hit them with the pickaxe. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yes, yes. That is that, that, I must say, that took me by surprise. I played blitz a few days ago, not long after the medallion was released. And what happened was that I got to the end game. I think there were two other people left and this guy was going around with the pickaxe. And I thought, okay, that's weird.

And I started shooting him. It was about to go down, but he hits me once with a pickaxe and I'm gone. And I seriously thought he was a hacker. Before I understood he actually had the one man punch medallion, which as you said kills the enemy with a single pickaxe hit, which I must say I was very surprised to find out they even added that to blitz, so.

**MatosPT:** I haven't played blitz recently, so I haven't tried it out, but I, I can see how you [00:02:00] see someone the pickax and you're going like, Oh, this is a bot Right? Just pickaxing his way out, and then he comes at you, he hits you once, and instead of doing like five or 10 damage, instantly kills you.

So I can see how, without having the knowledge of the new medallion, people would think it was a hack, actually, there were several topics on the Reddit regarding that. When it came out, many people thought the same thing. 

**RapidRaven880:** I think it was very unexpected and I mean on the one hand it feels way too strong. My initial reaction was that it was a stupid idea. I was very happy that they didn't bring it to Battle Royale. I think once you know that this thing exists, I'm not sure it's as strong as it looks, right?

Because to hit someone with a pickaxe, you [00:03:00] need to be really close to them.

**MatosPT:** Yeah. But depending on the movement that you have, if you have the fizz.

**RapidRaven880:** Fizz, yeah.

**MatosPT:** If you have the fizz it's very easy to get up and close. So it takes a bit of skill to use it properly. 

**RapidRaven880:** So you mean fizz yourself up and then jump on an enemy and pickaxe the guy. 

**MatosPT:** True. 

**RapidRaven880:** Okay. Yeah. I haven't played blitz since, to be honest, so I haven't had the time to experiment with it. The last time I saw it was when I got shocked by it,

we had some updates. So we have choppers now where choppers, the hammer a AR is gone, which was my favorite AR in the season. And we got shockwave hammers. What do you think about shockwave hammers?

**MatosPT:** I've been getting the hang of it, and I quite like to use it. So if you need to run, you'll [00:04:00] use the three hits of the hammer that you have, then you have to wait for it to reload. It's not, I don't think it's overpowered. I think it's a great item. It's a great movement. And in the final circles, it can be quite good to send people to the storm.

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah. Or if you are on top of a mountain to send them down a mountain to die of fall damage. One of the possibilities, I guess, to increase the range would be fizz plus shockwave hammer. If you fizz yourself up before a fight and then use the shockwave hammer and you fizzed up when you use it, then you should go further.

That certainly works with shockwaves or two shockwave hammers, right? Then you got six hits.

**MatosPT:** Yeah. I guess that's a solution, but then what do you take out of your inventory, right. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah, I think this season, if we're talking about this season, I would say that heals are not necessary. I think if you really need to choose something, you should choose movement and you [00:05:00] should drop the heals. You should probably take bunkers, but only if it's very, very close to the end game.

I wouldn't carry bunkers since the early game and it really depends which weapons you prefer. Another thing we got recently and I forgot to mention, are the snipers, right?

**MatosPT:** Ah, the old snipers, yeah. 

**RapidRaven880:** The snipers are very good. I'm taking snipers now instead of DMR. They have three shots before you need to reload. ~~What's your, what's your favorite one here?~~

~~Uh, or.~~

**MatosPT:** ~~I, I still prefer the DMR, ~~I still prefer the DMR basically because I've used the DMR so often recently that I've become, quite good with hitting the opponents with it. I've tried the sniper two, three times and it didn't go well. It's very hard for me to see the bullet drop and to calculate where I have to try to aim to hit the enemy. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah, I got a similar feeling moving from DMR to sniper. You do need to get used to it and get used [00:06:00] to the projectile movement specific of the sniper with its very large drop as the distance increases. So I do prefer the sniper. And of course the wrecked revolver, it's still on top of my list. So if I could choose, two things would be the wrecked revolver and the sniper, then a movement item possibly together with a fizz and heals or an AR. I might take an OXR, but I could do with just two weapons.

**MatosPT:** Oh, really? 

**RapidRaven880:** Yes.

**MatosPT:** Usually it's the DMR, it's the veiled precision SMG and then it's the wrecked revolver.

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah,

**MatosPT:** Then I try to take one heal and one hammer, ~~maybe a jump pad. ~~

**RapidRaven880:** ~~Yeah. ~~The jump pads are, are very good to, get [00:07:00] out of a tight situation. Talking about that: in the last episode, you mentioned one weapon that had a scope that we couldn't remember the name of, and that was the Veiled SMG, wasn't it?

**MatosPT:** Yeah. That's it. I've been using it quite a lot. I never liked it before. I guess it was competing with other very good AR, so I never looked at it because the damage is quite small. It shoots very fast, but the damage is very small. It's like 12 or 13 per hit, so it's very good for medium range, but if the enemy goes a bit too far, it's very hard to do. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah. I used to really like the veiled but then moved to the hammer AR and now with the wrecked revolver, I certainly prefer that. I will take a veiled if I have nothing else but it's not my preference nowadays. The other thing....

**MatosPT:** You use the wrecked revolver even for medium [00:08:00] distances? 

**RapidRaven880:** Yes, but I would have to aim down sights. So if I aim down sights, the aim of the wrecked revolver. Gets smaller, gets more accurate, and then you can use it for medium distances. I think it's very good for that. It has many shots. It just takes quite a while to reload. So you need to be very careful about not reloading in the middle of a fight.

That's one of the big mistakes is starting a fight and just having two or three bullets in the weapon. Then you are done, taken down while, reloading.

**MatosPT:** Yeah, even if you jump around it's very hard 

**RapidRaven880:** yeah.

**MatosPT:** get out of situation like that

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah, that's true. So another thing that I would like to go to if we don't have much more to say with regards to these very latest update is POIs.

We haven't talked about POIs this season. We have a bunch of very interesting POIs. We tend to, I think, focus pretty much on always the same ones I have to say. For quite a few [00:09:00] seasons our favorite one was Rebel's Roost on the Northwestern Corner, which doesn't exist anymore. I guess nowadays would be resistance 

**MatosPT:** let 

**RapidRaven880:** base.

**MatosPT:** Let me stop you in a bit. So, for people who don't know, what are POIs? POI is a place of interest. It's usually where they put like houses or they have an environment set up for that place and it's where usually concentrate the special chests. So there are good landing places to go instead of a middle of the forest where there's nothing there to pick up. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah, absolutely. And if you don't know the POIs for a season consults fortnite.gg. It has a lot of information including the POIs. Interestingly, we have been landing, or were landing last season pretty much in a POI, without a name that I learned recently is called Martial Maneuvers, which is just west of first order [00:10:00] base.

More recently, we've been going to Kappa Kappa Factory or Shoguns Solitude. They are, good POIs with quite a few things. And this season, since the drones are back, you can see where the drones are by checking the POIs with the golden font, there you'll have a lot of loot, possibly also more people landing there.

But in any case, even without drones, I really like Kappa Kappa Factory and Shogun Solitude -- more Kappa Kappa factory because of the possibility of rotation from there to other places like Outpost Enclave. What's your take on this?

**MatosPT:** I think going first on the drone issue, the drones are very good when you are on a team because they always drop shields and you know that when you drop on a drone zone everyone on the team will have full shields when they get out because in terms of [00:11:00] weapons that they drop, usually not that great, not very interesting to, to use the Kappa Kappa Factory and Shogun Solitude is usually a good option because they're not overpopulated. People tend to go directly to where there are bugs so they can rank up quite quickly and go to the vault so these two are good starting points to build a solid team and try to get some good weapons and go from there.

Yeah, we used to go to the Turtle, which I see in the map on fortnite.gg it's called the great Turtle. 

**RapidRaven880:** Great turtle. Yeah.

**MatosPT:** When it was the Star Wars chapter and that was also quite good. 

There's always like five chests around. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah, the great turtle and then from there outpost enclave. Right?

**MatosPT:** Mm-hmm. 

**RapidRaven880:** nowadays there's also a capture point there. Uh, some people also call it a flag. So you can raise [00:12:00] that even though the flag in outpost enclave is inside, lower ground and it's very easy to take down people there. 

**MatosPT:** Mm-hmm. 

**RapidRaven880:** needs to be careful.

**MatosPT:** Yep. 

**RapidRaven880:** Then we have martial maneuvers in the north, which I really like to go to. And I think from there, supernova Academy, it's a very big POI nearby that also has a capture point and lots of chests and so on. So I think that's also a good drop point. I don't know if I'm missing anything else.

**MatosPT:** I usually like also to go, mostly when I am, playing solo, a place on northeast calling called Placid Patties. It's like where they grow up the rice crops 

**RapidRaven880:** Northwest, right?

**MatosPT:** northwest. Yeah, sorry. And there's a truck, a slurp truck 

**RapidRaven880:** Mm-hmm.

**MatosPT:** there, and [00:13:00] there's six chest and it's quite a good place to go 

**RapidRaven880:** so quick question. Drop it like it's hot, or drop it like it's cold, and then have time to loot. What's your take?

**MatosPT:** I guess it depends. I usually drop it like it's hot if I'm doing quests and that's usually the only time I drop it like it's hot because the probability that I'll die in the first minute is too high and then it's two, three minutes to get back to the game. And it gets tiring to spend more time in the lobby and on the island waiting for players than actually playing the game.

Other than that, I prefer to go to the outskirts of the island. Go inside from there. Go with the zone. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yes, I agree. I really think that to have a good strategic game, you need to start in a place [00:14:00] without too many people, not too many teams, and from there you get basically your stuff together, your team gets together, starts to move with the zone and prepare for a good end game. 'cause I think if you want to win, if you want to get the crown you need to have a strategy.

So I think it's important to not go Rambo, I guess.

**MatosPT:** I had a game yesterday where I had good weapons. I was in the final three, but I tried to rambo it against the guy that I saw and it didn't work out, if I waited, if I had been more patience, uh, I would probably win. But I try to take out that guy so yeah, patience is almost a skill 

**RapidRaven880:** Mm-hmm.

Yeah, it happened the same to me. We were, [00:15:00] was there actually a game that where we were together in a squad and, very close to the end, one of the opponents in the other team was taken down. I saw that he had very good weapons and instead of waiting and being patient, I decided to use a hammer, shockwave hit to get those weapons.

But as soon as I got the weapons, I was swarmed up by his teammates. And that was it basically for me. And, obviously it made our teams work a lot harder. So that was on me.

**MatosPT:** Yep. It happens. It happens. It could have worked out, but sometimes it's worth, right? 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah, that's right. It's a learning process. That's why, Fortnite is a very interesting game in this regard. That that's a lot of things that come together for you to have regularly good games.

**MatosPT:** Mm-hmm. 

**RapidRaven880:** so about we have boons, [00:16:00] right? Boons are back, from, we had, I think we had boons a few seasons ago.

Now we have more boons, different ones and ones that come with a rank vaults that fall from the sky when you get a certain super soldier rank. So we have ranks b, a, s and s plus.

**MatosPT:** Hmm. 

**RapidRaven880:** We have some boon, some legendary boons that you can grab from capture points and so on. We had the vulture boon, the storm forecast boon extended magazine boon, and the agile aiming boon, which I must say I haven't seen in the last few days.

So I'm wondering if they were already removed. 

**MatosPT:** The Agile Aiming?

**RapidRaven880:** that was removed.

**MatosPT:** I don't 

**RapidRaven880:** No, I,

**MatosPT:** Were you talking about that one

**RapidRaven880:** talking about all of the ones, that are not from the Super soldier.

**MatosPT:** Uh, no. I got the Extended magazine boom today. 

**RapidRaven880:** [00:17:00] Okay. ~~Okay.~~

**MatosPT:** ~~So it might be, Yeah.~~

it might be just luck.

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah. 

**MatosPT:** Drops. 

**RapidRaven880:** because I remember, if I'm not mistaken, the Vulture boon, which is one of my favorite boons that. For those who don't know would show enemies who are eliminated on the map for a short amount of time. I used to get that in one of the OXR headquarters when you cleaned up the headquarter. But since the, headquarter is clean, you cannot get the vulture boon there anymore. I don't know if it disappeared completely or not.

**MatosPT:** Yeah. I think also a thing that we tend to do the same rotations, so when these boo Move we don't understand if they have been removed or if they have just moved because there are places that we never go right we never go to first order base We never go to Resistance [00:18:00] Base, Supernova Academy, we also never go.

So, there's quite a few places where we usually don't go. We tend to do the same rotations. So, there might be differences there that we haven't picked up on.

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah. That's right. I went a couple of times to first order base during the Star Wars season when it came up. It had a boss there, right? And it had a special weapon. I think it was a very good, mythic shotgun. 

**MatosPT:** Yeah. ~~On the bottom of first order base, right? ~~

**RapidRaven880:** ~~Yes, yes.~~

But since then,

**MatosPT:** bottom of the mountain. 

**RapidRaven880:** But since the Star Wars season finished, I haven't been going there anymore. Yeah. Uh, so what do you, what do you feel about the, the boons? Do you think they're a good addition to the game?

**MatosPT:** Yeah, I quite like it. The super soldier ones, I think they are too predictable in terms of, you know, exactly when and what super soldier you'll get. So I guess that takes the fun a bit out [00:19:00] of it. the other ones, I quite like it. And the fact that they are, a bit random, to drop. It's quite interesting and puts a factor of luck into the game. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah. I like them as well. That brings me to, to actually boons remind me a little bit of augments. Do you remember augments a few seasons ago?

**MatosPT:** I think it was during the first few months I played Fortnite, There were augments and then poof, they were completely removed. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yes. So. Those allowed you to get some special abilities, throughout the game and you could, it always gave you, I think, if I'm not mistaken, three options. And then you could choose one of them. ~~Uh, and~~

~~I don't think you need to play, I think it was sort of like a boo that would just show, um, but has been what, two years, uh, since we had augments so.~~

~~I, I, ~~I don't quite remember the details, but I do remember that back then we also had this interesting machine that allowed you to upgrade your weapon. And I remember that whenever I collected enough money, I knew where those machines were and I could just go [00:20:00] there and upgrade my, you know, rare or, epic to legendary.

I think they were very nice. I don't think we have that since

**MatosPT:** you mean the weapon upgrading? When you were talking, I thought you were talking initially about the mod benches, but Yeah. 

**RapidRaven880:** I was talking about yeah, what benches is different, right. That came later. That came I think maybe a year and a half ago or so, but we had upgrade machines where you could go to the machine and just upgrade the rank of the machine. So it was a sorry of the weapon, so you had exactly the same weapon.

upgrade it. You could upgrade it from rare to, to, to Epic and Epic to Legendary and so on.

**MatosPT:** Yeah, that was great. nowadays, I think I spend most of my money on reboot cards, so. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah. You just spend the whole time rebooting the team. That's the issue. I mean, yeah. That's interesting. That's also, that's a recent edition, right? Being able to buy reboot cards, is that a good [00:21:00] thing?

**MatosPT:** I think so. 

**RapidRaven880:** Because it annoys me to know that I just shoot someone down and, teammates can simply disappear from view. Just reboot the person without trying to grab his card. Before there was a little bit of strategy where if you take someone down, you know that for them to reboot their teammate, they'll have to come back and get their card.

**MatosPT:** You are gonna camp right there 

**RapidRaven880:** I mean, yeah, that's right. And it was an issue because if one of your teammates was taken down, you'd have to think very well what to do next a lot of the teams would camp waiting for you to come back for their teammates, but nowadays you can just go to the other side of the map and reboot them and then there's no point in staying there.

I guess so. I'm not sure. I'm a bit split on this buying of the reboot cards.

**MatosPT:** I think it's great that whether you buy one card or two cards, it's the same price. You [00:22:00] pay 500,

**RapidRaven880:** Mm-hmm.

**MatosPT:** regardless of the number of cards you'd buy. that kind of caught me by surprise the first time we played trios or squad, because I thought it was 500 per card.

What? The fact that it's 500, whether it's one, two, or three, it is very good, but it also makes you be aware that you should always have at least 500. because the gold economy, and it's something that we should talk about on the future episode. You nowadays have so much to, to spend gold on. You have market, have the, when you want to reboot, what, what is it called?

You reboot with two shields and one weapon, and it's like a thousand enhanced reboot, It's like a thousand gold 

**RapidRaven880:** expensive.

**MatosPT:** And then it's like 500 for buying the cart. So [00:23:00] unless people are very picky, where to spend their gold, it can go quite fast. 

**RapidRaven880:** and it's 800 per legendary weapon, 600 per epic weapon. So you just get, two legendary weapons in a match and, suddenly you spent 1,600. So it's very easy to just go to zeros and, I'm guilty of that sometimes.

**MatosPT:** Yeah. But the game is quite fun nowadays, I guess it's been quite a joy to play this season, although it's not, been our best season. But I think it has been our fault, 

**RapidRaven880:** Hmm.

**MatosPT:** but I think the items available, nowadays, I quite, quite good. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yes. Yeah, I agree. The season has been feeling a little bit. More sweaty than usual, I would say. And I don't know exactly why. I think we need to reserve one of the episodes to discuss the algorithmic choices made by Epic, because it feels unusual, but yeah.

**MatosPT:** Yeah, even before the end vault of the snipers [00:24:00] because sweaters usually Always have a sniper somewhere they're hiding and have a sniper somewhere, and even before the snipers they, it seemed to be quite sweaty in that regard. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah. Absolutely. I agree with that. The other thing that I remember from this is a little bit of nostalgia here I remember from a few years ago also from when we started back in, 2020, uh, three now. Was, the existence of these machines that allowed you to track, an opponent.

I really enjoy that because you could get visibility into where one of the opponents was, and you could track him down

when we had medallions, right? We don't have medallions anymore. They were removed a couple of weeks ago, I think it was with release of 37 10.

**MatosPT:** Only. Only on, only on on rank. [00:25:00] They're still on rank as far as I know. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yes, I think you're right. But we've been playing and ranked, so, we haven't had the opportunity to see the medallions, but I really like the medallions. I actually don't know exactly why they removed the medallions from unranked. It doesn't make much sense to me.

**MatosPT:** People complained, I guess. At least I, I've seen many people complain about it because if you could get all pre ions, it was very, very overwhelming. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah, fair enough.

**MatosPT:** but if that's the reason, it's strange that they kept it on rank and remove it from, they were like, okay, let people have fun on unranked without having, a free medallian person. And those who want a challenge go to, to rank them. see how they fit. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah, it's possible. It's possible that that was the case. Even then, some ranked games for me still feel like they were ranked. It just feels, as I [00:26:00] said, 

**MatosPT:** Mm-hmm. 

**RapidRaven880:** very, very sweaty. But I have to say, I enjoy them because. It's, it doesn't feel like it's a bot lobby where you enter and you just take down everyone and you can kill anyone outside.

Cover. And, you know, you have a player in front of you that cannot hit you a single shot. And that,

you know, it's nice to say, well, I have 20 kill per game. But if it's, they're all bots, I mean, I don't know what's the point, right? So I enjoy that. It's tight and then it also makes the win, more exciting.

**MatosPT:** Yeah, it doesn't do wonders for our, wins percentage. It's probably on the two, 3% right now, 

**RapidRaven880:** true.

**MatosPT:** It makes for a great game. 

**RapidRaven880:** That's true, that's true actually. You can see your, if you go to Fortnite Tracker, you can actually see your win percentage. So that will be an interesting, thing to see on how your win percentage changed, over [00:27:00] time. Right. So if I quickly check the wind percentage, which probably is similar for, what is it here?

Then, uh, I can tell you, is this this per, okay. Uh, all chapter six, season four.

Oh, it's not that bad, right? 10.4% wins, this season.

**MatosPT:** Really regarding, all modes solo and, trios

**RapidRaven880:** been playing, I've not really been playing solos. So this is generally, a team.

**MatosPT:** only Battle Royal or also, blitz? Only 

**RapidRaven880:** yes. Yeah.

**MatosPT:** yeah. 10% is better than I expected. What's, what's the percentage on previous seasons? 

**RapidRaven880:** in Bleed was, is 28 point. 28 point, uh, four, uh, in previous seasons for some reasons not [00:28:00] allowing me to choose, just allows me to choose. I can tell you my lifetime percent win percentage is 10%, is 9.6%.

Yeah. And, if I check chapter six, season four, and if I see the percentage, per, team size, then I win most as a dual, 15% as dos.

Then 6.8 is three use and 10.5 squads.

**MatosPT:** That's not 

**RapidRaven880:** it's not bad.

**MatosPT:** I was thinking it would be worse. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah. I guess we just remember the ones where we screw up.

**MatosPT:** Yeah. True. Yeah. Sounds, uh, sounds good. It's almost 40 minutes. 

**RapidRaven880:** So we have a.

We can spend a lot of time talking about for nights, but I'm sure, that we have other things do like playing some matches.

**MatosPT:** Yeah, true. [00:29:00] I have to go to Blitz to get some gold. 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah.

**MatosPT:** I think it's the best place to get gold nowadays. Is Blitz, Very good. It's very fast. And the thing I like about Blitz, In the same level as the quick gameplay is that it's very quick to go to the island, probably 'cause it has so many bots.

But either way, you don't have to spend a minute or two waiting, looking at the, the ceiling waiting for you to get to a game 

**RapidRaven880:** Yeah. Yeah, I agree. We'll be talking about blitz in, coming episode. That's a good idea. So.

**MatosPT:** for sure. 

**RapidRaven880:** First of all, thank you very much once again for, joining, me co-hosting this episode, to everyone listening, Gigi's, have some good games and I'll see wool in the lobby.

**MatosPT:** Gigi.

[00:30:00]
